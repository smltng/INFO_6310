# INFO_6310 Final Project
This repository contains the archives of my final project for INFO 6310, Behavior and Information Technology, where we studied the effect various styles of loading screens had on a given user's perceived waiting time.

In this repository, you will find three loading screens, one static, one animated, and one with interactivity present.

The files in this repository were originally being hosted in my GitHub pages, but are finally being migrated out to make way for other content.
